# Character Recognition with OpenCV and Machine Learning

This Python script is designed for character recognition using OpenCV and machine learning models. It processes images to recognize characters and provides predictions based on the loaded models. It consists of two main layers of character recognition.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- PIL (Pillow)
- Any additional machine learning libraries for your models

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/character-recognition.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python pillow  # Add other dependencies as needed
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the Python script to perform character recognition on an input image.

   ```bash
   python character_recognition.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts or modify the script to adapt it to your specific use case.

### Customization

- Replace the model loading section with your own machine learning models.
- Modify the code to suit your specific image processing and recognition requirements.

## Code Structure

The code is organized as follows:

- **`character_recognition.py`**: The main Python script for character recognition.
- **`README.md`**: This documentation file.
